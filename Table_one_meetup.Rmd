# What do we use **Table 1** for?

.center[![Table 1](C:/Users/PaloRS/Dropbox/github/Slides/nejmoa.jpg)]

# Disclaimers

##Before building your Table 1. be sure you know your data

- You already cleaned and prepared your data

- You know which variables are categorical, binary, continuous, discrete and..

- You know how you want to present them according to their properties (ex. mean vs. median)

# Let's get started!

---
# Get **tableone**

Install and open the **tableone** package 

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages(tableone)

```

``` {r }
library(tableone)
```

---
# Open the example dataset
```{r }
library(dplyr)
db <- starwars
```

---
```{r}
db

```
---

```{r}
glimpse(db)

db <- db %>% 
  select(-name)
```
---
#First case

You have a dataframe with all the variables to include in your Table1, and they are ready to be summarized (not this case).

```{r }
CreateTableOne(data = db)
```

---

#Second case
You want only some variables from your dataframe in your table 1

- Save your variable names in a vector

- Define which variables should be presented as categorical.
  Since they should be factors, the `CreateTableOne` function includes an option `factorVars`.

```{r}
db <- db %>% 
  mutate(human = case_when(
    species == "Human" ~ "Human",
    TRUE ~ "Other"))

myVars<- c("height", "mass", "birth_year", "gender", "human")

catVars <- c("gender", "human")
```

---
#Second case

```{r }
table2 <-CreateTableOne(vars = myVars, data = db, factorVars = catVars)
table2
```

---
#Options
- In case you want all levels for your categorical variables, use the option `showAllLevels`

- If you have skewed numerical variables, and want to present as median and IQR, use option `nonnormal`.To do this this save the names of the variables as a vector.

```{r}
skewed <- c("mass", "birth_year")

print(table2, showAllLevels = TRUE, nonnormal = skewed, explain = FALSE)
```
- If you don't want the description (mean, sd, %), set `explain = FALSE`

For more options to print, `?print.TableOne`

---
#Third case, by groups
- We want to see columns for each treatment. Use option `strata`

- By default, the table will include p-values that compare the characteristics between groups.

- It will use chi2 for categorical variables, tttest/Anova for numerical variables.

```{r }
table3 <-CreateTableOne(vars = myVars, strata = "human", 
                        data = db, factorVars = catVars)
```
---
```{r}
table3
```
---
- If you set variables as nonnormal, it will use Wilcoxon or Kruskal Wallis (in print fx)
- For categorical variables with small cell counts, use the option exact (in print fx)
```{r}
print(table3, nonnormal = skewed, exact = "gender", explain = FALSE)
```

---
#Cool extra to check missing data
```{r}
summary(table2)
```
---
#Exporting
If your table is going to word file, you can export int a .csv and make it pretty your way.

- Save your `print` code adding a few extra statements:
```{r}
table3_exp<- print(table3, nonnormal = skewed, 
                   exact = "gender", explain = TRUE, 
                   test = TRUE, quote = FALSE, noSpaces = TRUE, 
                   printToggle = FALSE)
```

- Export as a CSV file

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
write.csv(table3_exp, file = "Table3.csv")
```

#If you are use RMarkdown
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages(kableExtra)
```

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
```

---
#Use **kableExtra** and have fun!!
```{r}
library(kableExtra)
kable(table3_exp) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                full_width = F, font_size = 16)
```
---
#More on style!
```{r}
table_kable<- kable(table3_exp) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                full_width = F, font_size = 16) %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = " white", background = "#562457") %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T, color = " white", 
              border_right = T, background = "#88398A") %>%
  add_header_above(c("Star Wars character's description" = 5)) %>% 
  footnote(general = "Data from dplyr package",
           symbol = "nonnorm refers to Mann Whitney test",
           alphabet = "exact refers to Fisher exact test")
